# Next.js Assignment - Weframetech

This repository contains the frontend implementation for the Next.js assignment as part of the hiring process at Weframetech. The goal is to build a pixel-perfect frontend based on the provided Figma design. No API integration is required, and the focus is purely on building a responsive and well-structured UI that matches the design exactly.

## Requirements

- **Next.js** - Framework used for the project.
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling the components based on the design.
- **Lighthouse Score** - Ensure a Lighthouse score of 95 or higher for performance and accessibility.

## Figma Design

The design for the frontend is provided in the Figma link below. All styling, components, and layout should follow this design:

## 🧭 Approach & Thought Process

1. **Project Setup**  
   Initialized a fresh Next.js App Router project using the latest version. Tailwind CSS was configured for styling.

2. **Design Analysis**  
   Carefully inspected the Figma file. Used `pixel-to-rem` conversions and Tailwind utilities to match spacing, typography, and layout 1:1.

3. **Component Structure**  
   Broke the UI down into reusable and meaningful components like `Header`, `HeroSection`, `Card`, `Footer`, etc.

4. **Responsiveness**  
   Although no mobile Figma design was provided, I implemented a responsive layout from scratch using Tailwind’s responsive utilities (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.).

5. **Accessibility**  
   Added semantic HTML, alt text, and keyboard-friendly elements to ensure basic accessibility best practices.

6. **Performance Optimization**  
   Ensured images are optimized and components lazy-loaded where necessary. Minimal custom JavaScript to keep bundle size small.

7. **Testing**  
   Manually tested on various screen sizes and ensured consistent behavior. Lighthouse performance score was tested on [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).

## ✅ Lighthouse Score

The final deployed version achieves a **Lighthouse score of 95+ across all categories** (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO).  
A screenshot of the score is included in the Loom video and below.
